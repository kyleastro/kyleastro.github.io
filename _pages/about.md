I'm a second year PhD student in Astrophysics at the University of Exeter, UK. My project is to understand the formation of young massive clusters (YMCs) through numerical simulations. Currently, I focus on the formation of YMCs via cloud-cloud collision. My supervisors are [Prof Clare Dobbs](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/cld214) and [Prof Tim Naylor](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/tnaylor). I'm also associated with the ERC funded project [ICYBOB](https://icybob.co.uk/index.html).
