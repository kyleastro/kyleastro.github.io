I'm a third year PhD student in Astrophysics at the University of Exeter, UK. My project is to understand the formation of young massive clusters (YMCs) through numerical simulations. Currently, I focus on the formation of YMCs via cloud-cloud collision. My supervisors are [Prof Clare Dobbs](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/cld214) and [Prof Tim Naylor](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/tnaylor). I'm also associated with the ERC funded project [ICYBOB](https://icybob.co.uk/index.html).  

I'm from [Malacca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malacca), a beautiful and historical city in Malaysia. During my free time, I enjoy reading about things like theoretical physics, politics, and sometimes philosophy. I also like to pretend I understand them.
