Young massive clusters (YMCs) are recently formed astronomical objects in galaxies. They are commonly thought as the building blocks of galaxies, yet their formation is still not fully understood. Being young and massive, YMCs lie somewhere in between the old but massive globular clusters, and the young but less massive open clusters in the mass-age spectrum. A YMC typically has a cluster mass of more than 10,000 solar masses, a density of more than 10,000 solar masses per cubic parsec (1 solar mass per cubic parsec is about the density of outer space), an age of less than 100 million years and a small age spread of a few million years. A relatively well known YMC in our galaxy is [Westerlund 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlund_1).
