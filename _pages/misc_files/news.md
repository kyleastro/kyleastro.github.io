List of events (not necessarily just about me) since I started my PhD.

## 2020
### October 2020
* First external journal club talk given online to Radio Cosmology Lab, University of Malaya, Malaysia.
* Roger Penrose, one of the physicists I admire won the Nobel Prize in Physics 2020!
* I was featured in [100 Scientists of Malaysia](https://www.facebook.com/100Scientists/posts/362919765075782)! I did science communication for the first time using their account.

### September 2020
* First first-authored paper (Liow and Dobbs 2020) has been accepted for publication in MNRAS.
* This GitHub page was born!

### May 2020
* The [picture](https://exetersciencecentre.org/gallery/kong_uoe_eclipse/) of the solar eclipse, taken and edited by, and jointly submitted with my friend Jie Min for the South West Research Exhibition was exhibited in Exeter Science Centre.
* Third journal club talk given to Astrophysics Group in my university. It was also my first online talk.

### April 2020
* First co-authored paper (Dobbs, Liow and Rieder 2020) has been accepted for publication in MNRAS Letters.
* John Conway, a mathematician I know from his work in group theory and cellular automation, died. RIP.

### March 2020
* Another outreach, a stargazing night at Stoke Hill with fellow astronomers from my university. I observed Pleiades and ONC through a telescope for the first time.
* Attended Brian Greene's talk at the Royal Institution with Yee Ting. I read several of his books a few years back which sparked my interest in theoretical physics.

### January 2020
